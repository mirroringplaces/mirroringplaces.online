## Mirroring Places:
## An Archeology of Memories
### by Rodrigo Andreolli

<img src="/images/14_cloud.png">

Mirroring Places: An Archeology of Memories is a multimedia exhibition that interweaves different layers of time and locations. Spanning both the common housing area AKB København - Lundtoftegade in Denmark and the neighbourhood Bixiga in the center of Sao Paulo, Brasil, this art project reflects poetically on processes of memory, urbanization and space cultivation.
<br><br>
Created in collaboration between artist Rodrigo Andreolli - who is associated with the renowned Teat(r)o Oficina - , and Til Vægs - a platform for art in public space,this is a project that looks at gentrification in a global setting. No matter the wealth of a country, low-income residents are being pushed out of cities. What are the consequences of this development? How will the changing demographics influence the life of the cities, how will it influence us and what (hi)stories will disappear?
<br><br>
Mirroring Places: An Archeology of Memories is created on the basis of interviews with people who inhabit the two locations - interviews based on objects that are dear to the residents that Andreolli has 3D scanned. The exhibition exposes traces of the narratives gathered through those encounters and assembles them in mixed-media installations of both physical and augmented reality sculptures in the public space, revealing the diversity of lives that compose both locations and the resonating relations in between them.

Rodrigo Andreolli transits through performance and the performing arts.  Looking at the body as an element for sensitive activation of the visible and invisible layers of public matter and space, he creates works of multidisciplinary art often with an aspect of site specificity and local involvement.
Rodrigo Andreolli holds an MA in Choreography and Performance at the Institute for Applied Theater Studies (ATW), JLU, Gießen, Germany (2018-2021) and was Affiliated Researcher at ACT, Arts, Culture and Technology Program at MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2020).
<br><br>
Til Vægs is a platform for art in public space that opened in 2017. Working site specifically within the public housing area AKB København - Lundtoftegade, art is placed within the existing architecture and social life specific to the area. Here, the architecture, the atmosphere and the area's reputation and residents have a great influence as a setting, starting point and source of inspiration for the art program that is developed.
<br><br>
Teat(r)o Oficina is a renowned theater company founded in 1958 by a group of artists, directed by José Celso Martinez Correa. Located in Bixiga, São Paulo. Teat(r)o Oficina acts as a manifesto/theater, marked by great spectacles between theatrical expressions, musical presentations, dance and performances both within the iconic building designed by Lina Bo Bardi and in the public space surrounding it.
<br><br>
Mirroring Places: An Archeology of Memories is realized with funding from Nordisk Kulturfond -  Globus Call. The project is also supported by The New Carlsberg Foundation and The Danish Arts Foundation.
