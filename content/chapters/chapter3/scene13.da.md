<canvas id="c"></canvas>
<p>This image reveals a pair of objects used to protect the feet. Shoes. They are blue, intense and bright. Accumulation of imprinted symbols that indicate a certain mode of life of a civilization. Its shapes and contours seem to serve a specific type of movement. Soccer shoes. Owned by a boy, whose mother carries those shoes. This boy has a sister. She does not use similar shoes. The mother cares for both, and this is a lot of what she does. She makes sure they have food, rest and protected feet.</p>
