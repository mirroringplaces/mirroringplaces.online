<p>Here I see the image of these two objects who seem to carry a lot of personality and feelings. They look like they are expressing their emotions and at the same time, they stay together, side by side, with open arms. They seem to be made of wood and love. They carry the story of a mother and a son, when they can see each other in a profound moment of identification. At the moment they laugh about the same thing and reflect one another in each otherâ€™s eyes. Perhaps They symbolize a moment of recognition, and at the same time, they portray a company that lasts beyond a lifetime.</p>
