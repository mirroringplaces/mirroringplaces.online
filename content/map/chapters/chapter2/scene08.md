## Chapter &#9661;:
<h3 class="green">Scene 8: Stone Anhangabau</h3>
<canvas id="c"></canvas>

A stone that sits by a river covered by asphalt. It is by the margins of what was and will be a river, the one carrying the crafts of evil. But then when it flows, those crafts are washed away. Sitting on the stone, a man turns into a boy and flies back to places that he has never been. He came from afar and got trapped into walls, like the river is underground. As he sits on the stone, he finds his freedom in the world, he imagines his own victory, dreams of the old shoe factory, kisses his distant kids on their foreheads, feels the water on his feet, and plays with the time.
