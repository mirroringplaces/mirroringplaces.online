### Chapter &#9661;
## Scene 10: Dog
<canvas id="c"></canvas>

Boobie, the dog, was supposed to stay for a while, but Boobie merged with other creatures and they could no longer go by alone, each to their own side. Boobie was a dog to be rescued, but it ended up rescuing them so much more than they could initially realize.
