<p>This other image shows a round object, probably made of metal, an object that has traveled distances on this planet, has traveled long periods of time and also extends beyond the limits of a lifetime. It is the bridge for the love of a daughter, far from her land, dreaming every night of her long-gone mother. As it can no longer fit the size of her arm, she places this object under her head every night when she lies in bed, and as she closes her eyes, and slips into the realm of dreams, her mother sings in her ears an eternal lullaby.</p>
