<h3>Scene 23: Ot√°s - As time folds by</h3>
<canvas id="c"></canvas>
<p>This is a living archive of thoughts, projections and viewings crafted from the traces of collected data. They refer to personal objects and memories of people who inhabit this area. I say inhabit because I consider that people, objects and memory linger as parts of the structure of places they cultivate. I say cultivate, because I believe spaces are dynamic and change according to the elements that come together to form them, and that means a constant work of presence, care, arrangement, negotiation, relationality and nourishment. Work that is needed in order to continue existing or allow other existences in a place. I say place, or I say area, because I depart from specific localities, with their specific characteristics and compositions, to tell stories of other places that mirror those traces I can find in one specific spot. The world as we knew it, with time and space as a line, cannot support this reality anymore. It is all becoming a bundle of knots, like a beautiful chaotic knitting, that no one knows where it starts or finishes.I honor and thank all the elements of this land and of the other lands that emerged as part of this expression here-and-now. May the memories last for as long as they want to last, may our presences be the means for those stories to be told.</p>
