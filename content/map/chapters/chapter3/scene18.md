### Scene 18: Brick
<canvas id="c"></canvas>

A red clay brick with some symbols and some cracks on it. A brick that was part of a centenary wall and  witnessed the trances in between the living and the dead, through the art of the-act. A brick that shifted from hand to hand and then sat stillâ€¦. until it fell. It paves the way to the crafted desires of the space it defines. A brick as a spell.
