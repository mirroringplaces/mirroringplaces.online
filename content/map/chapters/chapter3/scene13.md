<canvas id="c"></canvas>

This object is a black tube with glass lenses on both ends.. For many years, It has been the companion of travels of this man who can only see well with one eye. It extends this manâ€™s own body, giving him the superpower of vision from afar. And the man extends the possibility of the object to move around, as he places this object in his bag and travels the world, it sees places it would probably never see otherwise. Together, they see the world changing since 1989.
