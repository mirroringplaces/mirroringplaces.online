<h3 class="green">Scene 5: Bottle Opener</h3>
<canvas id="c"></canvas>
<p>A piece of wood that resisted time. A piece of wood of about 20 cm, in a shape that looks a bit like a smoking-pipe, or a bird. It has two metal screws in its thicker end. A piece of wood that has existed in this form for more than 70 years. The very singular product of a man`s craft. An instrument. An object used to open other objects. A bottle-opener made by a grandfather, a carpenter who liked drinking. An inheritance to a son, who also likes to craft wood. A gift that traces the male flow on a blood line. From son to son, it reveals habits and developments of an entire man-kind.</p>
