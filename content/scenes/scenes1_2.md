    <h3>Troffey</h3>
    <p class="green">Here is an object made out of plastic and some metallic material, over a black cubic pedestal with a metal sign attached to it, placed over a  piece of paper or wood. In the top of its metallic part, we see a human figure, running along or jumping a ball. It is a representation of someone who succeeded in a game. It is the guardian of the memory of a father whose daughter used to play that game. He keeps this object to remember her, remember the time that has passed and made her a grown up. Time that has passed, brought other perspectives forward,  displaced their cultures. Perhaps this object represents achievements. Whose achievements?.... His?.... Hers?.....Theirs?....  It is a reminder of goals.</p>
