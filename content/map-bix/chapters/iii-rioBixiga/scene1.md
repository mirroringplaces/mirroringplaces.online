<p>Hahahahahaha-ha-ha-ha, I can hear a laugh from here
just the humor, this earthquake,<br>
all the water inside<br>
bubbles<br>
oozes<br>
vibrates<br>
trembles<br>
splashes<br>
the stream of joy gushes from head to toe
ora yeyê ô<br> 
tune in to the buried bloodstream!<br>
under the ground<br>
the apotheosis of our passion!<br>
everything that comes from below hits me<br>
and in the eye of the hurricane<br>
I look into the watery eyes of the most primitive life<br>
The world's first danced movement,<br>
it overflows!<br>
without its bath there is no joy<br>
without its mirages there is no silence<br>
without its waterfall there is no feast<br>
without its fountain there is no abundance<br>
without its water there is no life<br>
Bixiga River<br>
dance, dance!<br>
take possession of the face of the earth<br>
fulfill your destiny as the vanguard of all that is alive<br>
avenge your poisoned body<br>
</p>
