<p>/ Our incense is carried in the Alguidar (ceramic bowl), the clay, but it's also used for other things, right? But we use it to bring our incense in the Alguidar, something from the earth, from clay, right? The food we bring is our offertory, food when I say it is cake, cassava, sugar cane, all those things from the earth, so we bring the herbs thrown on the ground, for the people, when they leave, to be stepped on. Why? To give off that perfume. The herbs are medicinal herbs. The colorful clothes. The atabaque (drums). The atabaque, by itself, it speaks, right? The sound of the atabaque. And the atabaque, what happens? It starts with the blacks and the Indians. So it announces that a child has been born, someone has died, the rain is coming, the harvest. The atabaque itself spoke, go on. And who will it speak to inside the church? Our songs, our singing. And the very happy, very festive songs. And the colorful clothes. Why colorful clothes? Because black people like to show off. Not like the others, who come with the same clothes. Each one wears a different outfit. Yes, but why do you also come in dancing with a Bible full of ribbons? He said, because we don't just pray for ourselves, we pray for all the continents.</p>
