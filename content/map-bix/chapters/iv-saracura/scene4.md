<h3>Saracura -<br>Luciana Ara√∫jo</h3>
<p>On December 22, we planted a baobab tree in Dom Orione Square. Yes... the idea... They were baobabs that were part of a project, a campaign that the Unified Black Movement has been doing with this thing, right?</p>

<p>The baobab is the tree that, in Africa, became known as the tree of forgetfulness and there is information that when people were about to be kidnapped in Africa, they would go round the baobab seven times to forget everything before... they were brought, kidnapped to various areas of the European or American continent, wherever, and for the black movement, the baobab has also been understood as a tree of life, a tree linked to ancestry, which is why baobabs are being planted in various places.</p> 

<p>And there's our little baobab. Perhaps, Exu will want it, we can get it moved to a place where it can grow freely and the baobab will be gigantic. Nearby, in the area of the station that... allow me to point out that, for example, they demolished the tamarind tree, where there was a historic samba circle, which is now 30 years old, of the old guard of Vai-Vai, the tamarind tree family.</p>

<p>If we don't have a tamarind tree, let's have a baobab tree and maybe we'll replant a tamarind tree too, so that we can reaffirm our bond.</p>
