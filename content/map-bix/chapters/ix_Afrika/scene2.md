<h3>Yannick Dellas - Centro Cultural Afrika</h3>
<p>I have an object that I got from Hasan, who is from Palestina, and who has a space here called Al Janiah. It's the first house I played in São Paulo. And I played there for a long time, I did a lot of projects. This space also gave me the wings to think that it was necessary to create a space, because I did a lot of projects there and I curated. I realized that there were a lot of people who needed the place, the space to try out their projects and I couldn't accommodate everyone because I only had one day of curating, which was Wednesday.</p>

<p>But there were a lot more people. And there I got a... Something like that, I don't know what to call it. A little safe. Look, here's what it's used for. This is what Hasan used to pass the hat around. I used to play a lot passing the hat. You know? I used to play with a hat on.  Hey, in life. I used to play with a hat on a lot. Like I used to.  Tuesday, I'm passing by, Yannick, there's a lot of people there, do you want to play?</p>

<p>I always had my guitar. Do you want to play? Let's go! Then I'd sit there, I'd play, he'd get that thing, he'd pass it on to get, like, a payment there, passing on a hat and he'd use that one. Then, when the old Al Janiah house closed, it was on Álvaro Carvalho, downstairs, when it closed, he came here, he gave it to me, said, Yannick, this is it.</p>

<p>I weighed the hat there. So he gave me this hat. He sold that. He sold it. He came from there, from Palestina. But that one was just for picking up. Mine was just to get a little box, right? It was to get money from a hat.</p>
