<p>The space is empty.<br>
Silence.<br>
The light is pale, whitish.<br>
It's the white hour,<br>
when the night is gone and the sun has not yet arrived.<br>
It's just before dawn.<br>
Everything is milky.<br>
Little by little,<br>
slowly,<br>
the light rises,<br>
colors everything.<br>
They are fresh colors,<br>
and faint,<br>
a mist rises from the earth.<br>
It's the earth's first breath.<br>
Dew.<br>
A sound.<br>
A vibrato.<br>
A chord.<br>
Sêmele's etherno firefly glows.<br>
Water flows.<br>
A breeze blows.<br>
As if suddenly, Dionyzos is here.<br>
He enters.<br>
He has entered.<br>
In the Silence.<br>
He arrives with women.<br>
They walk,<br>
moving forward,<br>
scarves of mist on their legs.<br>
Footsteps.<br>
Walking roots.<br>
With each step you hear the sound of the earth.<br>
Deaf.<br>
Intense.<br>
Present.<br>
Ready to get ready.<br>
The Divine Gang has descended.<br>
Dionyzos consults compass and watch.<br>
He looks at the crowd.<br>
He has an appointment.<br>
In this place,<br>
at that time,<br>
with the crowd present.<br>
Right on time.<br>
History is happening.<br>
He's calm and passionate.<br>
He and the Maenads, during the prologue, really discover the audience.<br>
It's a thrill for them.<br>
They really enjoy discovering each person.<br>
The thrill of a new world.<br>
The new world of each moment.<br>
They really are sailors.<br>
With great pleasure.<br>
The Olympos of the Maenads and Dionysos is the audience.<br>
They see and look deeply at each person's god.<br>
And that's where the enchantment comes from.<br>
(subtext prologue for the Bacchae by Catherine Hirsch, Zé Celso, Denise Assunção)
