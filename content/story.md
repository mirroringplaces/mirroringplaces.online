    <p>I am walking through this place and taking notes about the things I see, about the things I find. Nothing seems to be permanent here. Like a foreigner, an alien coming from another place, I try to figure out my relations to this space. I look at the ground, I feel the air, I sense the water running by beyond my feet and in small particles in the air (deep inhalation)... I can smell the presence of so much life that is passing by.</p>

    <p>I travel way beyond the speed of light, so everything here is slow to me, to my eyes, but through a sense of extreme empathy, I feel what it is like to move like a stone, like a tectonic plate floating on the melting core of this planet, holding up where this piece of land stands.</p>

    <p>On my path, I find these objects that are like remains of a time capsule, as they keep on their surfaces and in their materials, traces of data revealing memories from the ones who have once cultivated this space.</p>

    <p>Time and space are folded. Past and future are now happening at the same time: present. And different places on this globe touch each other, like one hand touches another; like my skin touches the air; like my feet touch the ground.</p>

     <p>I open this time capsule and these memories emerge to me! They appear as images that carry feelings and I can describe them as they come to me; I become part of the ruins of a civilization constructed upon things, from which what lingers is the idea of a place built by the relations that have, through all the layers of time, insisted on being here.</p>
