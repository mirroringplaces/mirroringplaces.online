    <p>I am walking through this place and taking notes about the things I see, about the things I find. Nothing seems to be permanent here. Like a foreigner, an alien coming from another place, I try to figure out my relations to this space. I look at the ground, I feel the air, I sense the water running by beyond my feet and in small particles in the air (deep inhalation)... I can smell the presence of so much life that is passing by.</p>

    <p>I travel way beyond the speed of light, so everything here is slow to me, to my eyes, but through a sense of extreme empathy, I feel what it is like to move like a stone, like a tectonic plate floating on the melting core of this planet, holding up where this piece of land stands.</p>

    <p>On my path, I find these objects that are like remains of a time capsule, as they keep on their surfaces and in their materials, traces of data revealing memories from the ones who have once cultivated this space. </p>
